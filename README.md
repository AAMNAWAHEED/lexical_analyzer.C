# lexical_analyzer.C
this is the coding of first phase of compiler that is lexical analyzer in  C language.
lexical analyzer is the phase of compiler that takes the input and create tokens from that.
I performed it through following strategy:
1-take code from file "abc.txt".
2-then pass it through all functions to determine classpart or if there's any error.
3-print classpart,value part and line no.
